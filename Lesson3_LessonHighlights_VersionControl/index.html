            <p class="lead">If you ever mess up on a project or lose a piece of work that can never be retreived again, Version Control Systems are your savior. Version Control allows you to retrieve previous files and revert them back to an original stage and much more. It is simply a collection of files stored together on a system that records changes made over time, allowing users to manage their files and easily recover lost files at specific dates/times. This file storing system is very useful for graphic or web designers, because when they make a mistake or don't like certain changes they make to their file, they can go back and grab the original file or another previous version.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository is a collection of stored files located on a server that is accessible for everybody in the vicinity to view. For projects in this class, our remote repository is located on Github. Usually, it's located on networks like the Internet. When collaborating with a group, a remote repository is beneficial because it is accessible by every member and it allows them to individually view and share all the original files and versions. Pushing and pulling are two common techniques used to transfer data and files from the remote repository, which is Github in our case, to the local repository, which is Cloud9, and vice versa.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is different because each user has their own copy of files on their device rather then the files being stored on a server where everybody can access it like a remote repository. Our local repository would be Cloud9. Cloud9 is instlaled on all of our individual devices and acts as a personal copy of our files for our specific device. In order for a group to see the work you just completed on your device, it needs to be uploaded to the server and a remote repository. There are two ways to create a local repository.You can create a new repository from the beginning or clone an existing remote repository onto your computer or other device.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When using Git, it is important to understand that there are three stages that a file must be in and three states that a file can reside in within each stage. When a file is in the working directory, Git reads this file as modified. New files and modified files in a directory are not yet ready to be staged or snapshotted by Git to put in the local repository. When a file is labeled as staged, it is in the staging area which is when the file prepares to be stored in the local repository. Finally when a file has been committed/snapshotted it goes into the git directory, where is it stored permanently in the Git directory.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Commit</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In order to move a file into the git directory it first has to be committed. A more simple way to define commit would be to take a snapshot of a file. Once a snapshot has been taken it is recorded permanently in the local repository and previous versions can be retained and restored. The way Git stores its files by taking snapshots is a unique way, and different from many VCSs. The command "git add" takes the snapshot and the command "git commit" stores your snapshot in your history. In each recording, your email address and name is recorded within each file. </p>
